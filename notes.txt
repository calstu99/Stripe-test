Using Github

Push to Github repository

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/calstu99/testing1.git
git push -u origin main


**** Important If you want to change the URL of the existing remote repository, 
you can update it using the following command:

***********************************************
$git remote set-url origin https://new-url-here

***********************************************

To resolve this issue when you push ( src refspec main does not match), you can follow these steps:
1) Ensure Local Branch Exists:
Make sure that the branch you are trying to push exists in your local repository.
 You can create a new branch or switch to an existing branch using git checkout -b <branch-name> or git checkout <branch-name>.

2) Add and Commit Changes:
Add your changes to the staging area using git add . or git add <file> and commit them using git commit -m "Your commit message".

3) Set Upstream Branch:
If the branch does not exist on the remote repository, you can set the upstream branch by pushing with -u or --set-upstream option: git push -u origin <branch-name>.

4) Push Changes:
Finally, push your changes to the remote repository by running: git push origin <branch-name>.
